# Rev B - Sept 9, 2023

Updated design suitable for PCB manufacturing and hand-soldering

Non-functional changes:
 * The 74LS07 and related pull-up resistors have been replaced with another 74LVC245
   to reduce unique part count and waste less power
 * The dedicated 3.3v regulator has been removed in favor of using the voltage
   regulator on the Pico
 * MOSFET Q1 may be used instead of diode D1 in the Pico's power supply which
   will reduce wasted power

Functional/breaking changes:
 * The VGA connector J2 was changed from a 1x8 pin header to a 2x4 pin header/IDC connector
 * Pico GPIO10 is now connected to the Apple bus SYNC signal (via U4 for voltage translation).
   There is jumper block JP1 with cuttable & bridgeable pads for reconfiguring GPIO10 back
   to the Rev A behavior (U3 direction control) (Big thanks to Brian @swetland for this idea)


# Rev A - Jan 2, 2022

Initial design for laying out and wiring chips on a protoboard
